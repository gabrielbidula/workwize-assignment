# What was done and what is missing

Within the time frime I was not able to finalize the project and some features are missing.
Nonetheless, hereby follows what I could have done with more time.

* Api
  * Implement missing features ie: Checkout and Order.
  * Comply with design patterns as Services and Repositores.
  * Add Queue Jobs ie: AddProductToCartJob and RemoveProductFromCartJob.
  * Refactor code structure leaning towards a DDD approach.
  * Standardize Exceptions and how to handle it.
  * Refactor tests ie: add parent setup and use datasets instead of rewriting most of the use cases.
  * Add more complexity to tests and add feature tests to cover whole application flow.

* App
  * I defined the stack to be used which would be NextJs, React and Tailwind but:
    * I was only able to create a few pages and routes ie: Login, Signup and Products.
    * I was not able to hook the Api with the App.
  * I believe that with more time, even though I have no experience in the the App stack, I would be able to implement the project.

* Deliverable
  * As the project was not finalized I did not host it.
  * My personal preference to host the project would be using [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) for the API and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for the App.
